// 1. Implement the ArrayList using the prototype.
Array.prototype.myUcase = function() {
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    this[i] = this[i].toUpperCase();
  }
};

// 2. Complete the createNonSortedRandomArray(size) below by returning an
//    ArrayList with the numbers 1, 2, ..., size in random order.
//    NOTE: there are multiple ways to achieve this.

for (var a=[],i=0;i<40;++i) a[i]=i;

    tmp = array[current];
    array[current] = array[top];
    array[top] = tmp;
  }
  return array;
}

a = shuffle(a);
// 3. Implement the Quick Sort algorithm and test your code with the function
//    you wrote for (2).

           return recursiveFunction(arr, x, start, mid-1);
       else
     
           // If element at mid is smaller than x,
           // search in the right half of mid
           return recursiveFunction(arr, x, mid+1, end);
   }
      
   // Driver code
   let x = 5;
      
   if (recursiveFunction(arr, x, 0, arr.length-1))
       document.write("Element found!<br>");
   else document.write("Element not found!<br>");
      
   x = 6;
      
   if (recursiveFunction(arr, x, 0, arr.length-1))
       document.write("Element found!<br>");
   else document.write("Element not found!<br>");
